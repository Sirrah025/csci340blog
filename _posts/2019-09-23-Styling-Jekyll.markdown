# How I learned to stop worrying and love the jekyll

So this was a very interesting lab for me. Especially so when the teacher underestimates how difficult the lab would be.

I tired to use the [Massively](https://github.com/jekyllup/jekyll-theme-massively) template but I found out two things:
- Massively is much more difficult to use than Long haul
- Massively cannot be copy and pasted without a bunch of editing.

So in the end I decided to use [Long Haul](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) because it is the easiest theme I can work with and doesn't require a lot of back and forth copying and pasting to make it work. However, that is what I had to do to get the theme to work.

I did learn:
- how to find errors in my project files
- how to change the jekyll theme
- What a weird thing jekyll is
- that jekyll is fun to use
- layouts are really weird and I am still a bit unsure about them, but they work.
