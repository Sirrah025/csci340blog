# My first experience with jekyll (and command prompt)

Before I start, I want to say that whenever you have to open up command prompt to install software you spontaneously feel like a world class hacker and that things will get funky on your computer if you miss one letter.

A particular case was when I had to open up Gemfile and I found that the csci340blog folder was in the wrong place. This wouldn't allow myself to commit changes to GitHub, which I still won't understand why, but I had to delete and recopy it before I went about doing anything else.

Of course after I was able to install all I needed, and learned how to use and understand [some commands in command prompt](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-command-prompt/), I was able to see the files in Atom. I press commit and I go to my blog to check it out and it looked weird.

It didn't look like it did when I ran a local server of jekyll. I was confused as to where I went wrong when I realized why it looked weird. I didn't use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to push my commit to GitHub. I did it, and lo and behold it works. I don't understand why that is, but as long as it works I'm good.

In the coming semester I look forward to:
- become more comfortable working with markdown
- style my jekyll blog
- use the blog to update on where I am in the project.
