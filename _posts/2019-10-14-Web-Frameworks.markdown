#My impression on various web frameworks

From what I have seen, each web framework offer their own advantages and disadvantages when creating a website:

- Django offers a simple framework built around the Python programming language, however I am very concerned about installing it. It seems that those who tried to install had found difficulties getting it on due to vague tutorials. The demonstration shows that Django is pretty fast and easy to learn.

- ASP.NET seems like another easy framework. It is built on the C# language, which I have not had the chance to learn yet, and overall offers easy conveniences that make working with it simple. The demonstration I am shown helps to understand how to use the framework, and the MVC system works wonders for the demonstration. One thing I am concerned about is how to do css.

- Express seems like a simple framework, but I am concerned that you need to install other things in order to use anything involving databases. It is also not very efficient. Coding in it doesn't seem too hard. It uses javascript as its programming language. However, I don't feel confident using it as a framework.

- Flask seems like an intuitive system to use. The way of making routes is surprisingly simple, and the use of python means that the whole framework is really easy to use. I am a bit concerned about how to do multi-page websites, as the demonstration didn't show how to create multiple pages. On the plus side, it is not hard to implement.

- Laravel uses a programming language known as PHP, which surprisingly looks easy to understand. Installation looks complicated to do, and one slip-up could cause installation to not work, but the rest of the framework looks easy to understand. It also seems like it works very well with SQL databases, so it would work well for what we need to accomplish for our websites.

Overall, these web frameworks look great to use and I am excited to see what the class does with these.
