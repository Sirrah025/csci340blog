Hello,

I am William Harris, but I prefer to be called Will. I have shown an interest in computers for a very long time. As I grew up, I started to learn about programming. Now, I am taking classes on programming to learn more about how it and software works. I am also a huge video game nerd and I am a bit interested in learning game programming some time in the future.
