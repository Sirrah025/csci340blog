Video games have always been a fascination for me, especially ones that take advantage of the immersiveness of the medium to tell a story or create a sense of fun.

I remember one game from the N64 that did this very well was Banjo-and-Kazooie, a platform game where you play as a bear and bird combo. I didn't play the game a whole lot, my brother was given the console and game, but I did watch it a lot. The world was such a whimsically creative world, and the characters match it as well. I couldn't think of anything else that involves a bear and bird collecting puzzle pieces and musical notes to stop an ugly witch.

Another game I remember liking a lot as a kid was Spider-Man 2, a game that shouldn't have been good but is so fondly remembered. It promised one thing: Swing around New York like Spiderman. And it does this very well, even if I always bumped into buildings because the swinging was hard to control. Even though my brother owned the Xbox as well, I played that game a lot.

Though I would later find that it was a lot harder to immersive myself into a game as I exited childhood. Every game quickly became just that: a game. The worlds were nice, stories were captivating, and the characters were enjoyable. But I couldn't immerse myself into the game. Until I played The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. Its a Western RPG and one of the finest, in my opinion. The world was good looking, characters weren't all that complex, and the story is quickly sidelined by the side quests; however, it did immerse me into the world very well. There was always something to find, something to do, and something to fight with. It presented an open landscape to explore and carve my own path in, even if the glitches rear their ugly head in.
